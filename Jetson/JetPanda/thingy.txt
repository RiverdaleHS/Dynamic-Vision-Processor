How to find the field of view:
	cameraFieldOfView = 2*atan(0.5*imageWidth/focal_length)

How to find the center of the image:
	centerX = imageWidth / 2 - 0.5
	centerY = imageHeight / 2 - 0.5

Find the X and Y points: 
	PointX = X/Z * focal_length + CenterX
	PointY = Y/Z * focal_length + CenterY

Find the angles:
	angleHorizontal = atan(PointX-CenterX)/focal_length)
	angleVertical = atan(PointY-CenterY)/focal_length)
