How to find the field of view:
	cameraFieldOfView = 2*atan(0.5*imageWidth/focal_length)

How to find the center of the image:
	centerX = imageWidth / 2 - 0.5
	centerY = imageHeight / 2 - 0.5

Find the X and Y points: 
	pointX = X/Z * focal_length + centerX
	pointY = Y/Z * focal_length + centerY

Find the angles:
	angleHorizontal = atan(pointX-CenterX)/focal_length)
	angleVertical = atan(pointY-CenterY)/focal_length)

    pointX = X / Z * focal_length + centerX
    pointY = Y / Z * focal_length + centerY
    angleHorizontal = math.atan((pointX-CenterX)/focal_length)
    angleVertical = math.atan((pointY-CenterY)/focal_length)
