Our project is intended to make vision processing easier for FRC teams. 
Traditionally, not all FRC teams have the resources necessary to allocate a programmer to just vision processing.
Our final product will require minimal configuration: all it needs is the constraints for camera,
such as lens distortion and a 2-3 line Python file to define the target.
Then, our program will do the rest of the work. 
It will recognize the targets they specified in the configuration file, and calculated the distance to them
