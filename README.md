This program detects targets like these ones...

Makes them look more like this using an HSV to binary filter

![Targets 2](/Jetson/JetPanda/testImages/demoImage-1.jpg?raw=true)

Then, we identify the targets that meet the specifications set in the configuration file.

And we record the locations of those targets.

Using the location, we are able to get the yaw of the robot relative to the target and the distance from the target to the robot.
